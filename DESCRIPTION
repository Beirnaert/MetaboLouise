Description: Simulating dynamic (longitudinal, time-resolved) metabolomics data based on an underlying biological network. The network is initiating with certain concentrations and evolves over a simulated time period. Optionally external influxes (concentration drivers) can be added. More details can be found in Beirnaert et al. (2018) <https://doi.org/10.1101/482224>
